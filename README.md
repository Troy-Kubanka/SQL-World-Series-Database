# World-Series-Database
This is an upload of my group's completed database of the MLB World Series. 
We used MySQL and designed our DB using PHPMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, and hardcoding in SQL.
We designed an ERM & ERD to distinguish relationship types and processes of Normalization. 
Our Database included 15 tables (3 linking tables), queue tests, triggers, views
Tables included features like PKs, FKs, SKs, and surrogate Keys wherever necessary or convenient.
